# Synchronous FIFO Design using Verilog
A Synchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) Memory is a type of data buffer used in digital systems to manage data flow between components operating at the same clock frequency. It's commonly used in digital designs where data needs to be queued and processed in a first-in, first-out manner, ensuring that the order of data entry is preserved during output.

# Objective:
The goal of this project is to design, implement, and verify a Synchronous FIFO using Verilog. The design will focus on achieving efficient data buffering with minimal latency, ensuring that the FIFO can handle varying data input rates while maintaining data integrity and order.
